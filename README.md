6. **Free Asset Used in the Scene:**
   The forest scene is based on a free Unity asset, which you can find at the following link:
   [Lowpoly Environment Nature â€“ Free Medieval Fantasy Series](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/lowpoly-environment-nature-free-medieval-fantasy-series-187052).

7. **Run the Scene:**
   - After opening the scene, press the `Play` button in the Unity Editor.
   - You can now explore and interact with the scene.

8. **Running with a VR Headset:**
   If you'd like to experience the project with a VR headset, we recommend following this tutorial on setting up VR in Unity:

## Differences with Project Plan
We have followed the project plan closely throughout the development process. As a result, the implementation matches the expected output outlined in the plan. Any deviations were minor and did not impact the core objectives of the project.

## Experiment Preperations

To ensure the experiment runs as smoothly as possible, we must make sure the following requirements are met:
1. The VR headset is fully charged and the controllers have sufficient battery life.
2. Ensure that there is sufficient room for the participant to complete the exercise.
3. On the laptop, the [Meta Quest Link app](https://www.meta.com/nz/quest/setup/) is open.
4. After the VR Headset is on and boundaries are set, plug in headset into laptop using a USB-C connection.
5. After establishing the Meta Quest Link, run the scene in Unity to get started.
